/*  
    In Js we have various kind of loops, and all these loops
    essentially repeat an action a number of times. We have:
    - For.
    - While.
    - Do...While.
    - For...in.
    - For...of.
*/

// For loops.
// For loops need 3 statements,
// - The first is called initialExpression (here we declare an initialized variable)
// - The second is what we call a condition, we compare the value of the first expression
//      with something else. The loop will run as long as this condition evaluates to true.
// - The third part is called incrementExpression,we use this part to increment the value
//      of the initialExpression once a loop is completed.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
