// In the previous file we created an object usign Object Literal Syntax,
// but there's a problem here.
// Imagine if we wanted to create two cirlce objects. Like this:
let circle = {
  radius: 1,
  location: {
    x: 2,
    y: 3,
  },
};

let circle2 = {
  radius: 1,
  location: {
    x: 2,
    y: 3,
  },
};

 * ! the problem we have here
