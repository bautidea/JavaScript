    <!-- 
      As a best practice we should put the script element in the last part of the body section.
      Because:
        1- The browser parses the files from top to bottom, so, if the JS script is at the top, 
          you might have a lot of JS code, and the browser might get busy parsing and extecuting,
          that JS code, and it wont we able to render the content of the page. The page will be
          white or blank, while browser is parsing and executing JS code.
        2- Almost always the code that we have between <script> element need to talk/target to the 
          elements in this web page. So by adding the code at the end, will be confident that all 
          these elements are rendered by the browser.
      Ther are exceptions to this rule, sometimes we are using 3rd parties code that has to be placed
      in the head sections, but these are exceptions.

        We always apply Separation of Concerns, we want to separate html, wich is all about content,
