/*  
    In js we have two types of variables:
        - Primitives / Value Types - String, Numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.
        - Reference Types - We will talk about these later on.
    In ES6 we also have the primitive type Symbol, we are going to see this type later
    on.

let name = "Bauti"; // String literal.
let age = 30; // Number literal.
let isApproved = true; // Boolean literal.
let firstName; // Undefined.
let lastName = null; // We use null when we want to explicitly clear the value of a variable.
