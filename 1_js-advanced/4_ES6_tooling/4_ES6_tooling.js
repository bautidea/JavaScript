// ES6 Tooling
// When using modern JS we need two kind of tools
//  - Transpiler --> Is the combination of two words, Translator and Compiler. Its a tool
//                   that we give it our JS code, and it will convert the code into code
//                   that all browesers can understad.
//    Babel is a very popular transpiler for modern JS.
//  - Bundler --> Responsible for combining all our JS files into a sinlge file, which we call
//                bundle. We give our all Js files and they get converted into a single file,
//                the code will get minified by getting rid of all the white space and comments,
//                name of identifiers (like classes, functions, obejcts, etc) will get shorten
//    Webpack is a very popular bundler.
